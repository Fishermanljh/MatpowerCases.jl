The code in MatpowerCases.jl is distributed under the MIT license, a copy of which is produced below. The .mat files containing transmission network data were generated, via MATLAB, from .m files contained in MATPOWER (whose license is also included below). These files are not covered by the GNU General Public License, nor are they covered by the MIT license I have applied to this project. The original network data was included in MATPOWER by permission or derived from public sources. Its presence here is predicated on fair use. This package is for non-commercial, educational purposes. Also, it has no effect on the value of MATPOWER, which is itself an open-source, education-oriented software package.

One .mat file (the one pertaining to the RTS-96 system) was generated using a .m file
